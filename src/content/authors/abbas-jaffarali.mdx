Abbas has been covering tech for more than two decades- before phones became smart or clouds stored data. He brought publications like CNET, TechRadar and IGN to the Middle East. From computers to mobile phones and watches, Abbas is always interested in tech that is smarter and smaller because he believes that tech shouldnâ€™t be something that gets added to your life- it should be a part of your life.
